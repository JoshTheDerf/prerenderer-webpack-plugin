## About prerenderer-webpack-plugin

<p>***Note: This package is unstable and still under active development. Use at your own risk.***</p>

The goal of this plugin is to provide a simple prerendering solution that is easily extensible and usable for any site or single-page-app built with webpack.

It's implemented as a webpack wrapper for [prerenderer](https://github.com/tribex/prerenderer).
For more up-to-date and complete documentation, see that repository.

Plugins for other task runners and build systems are planned.

## Example Usage (`webpack.config.js`)
```js
const path = require('path')
const PrerendererWebpackPlugin = require('prerenderer-webpack-plugin')
const BrowserRenderer = PrerendererWebpackPlugin.BrowserRenderer // or JSDOMRenderer, or ChromeRenderer

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    ...
    new PrerendererWebpackPlugin({
      // Required - The path to the webpack-outputted app to prerender.
      staticDir: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'),
      // Required - Routes to render.
      routes: [ '/', '/about', '/some/deep/nested/route' ],

      // Optional - This is the default.
      // or new ChromeRenderer({ command: 'chrome-start-command' })
      // or new JSDOMRenderer()
      renderer: new BrowserRenderer()
    })
  ]
}
```

Now, if you're not familiar with the concept of *prerendering*, you might predictably ask...

## What is Prerendering?

Recently, SSR (Server Side Rendering) has taken the JavaScript front-end world by storm. The fact that you can now render your sites and apps on the server before sending them to your clients is an absolutely *revolutionary* idea (and totally not what everyone was doing before JS client-side apps got popular in the first place...)

However, the same criticisms that were valid for PHP, ASP, JSP, (and such) sites are valid for server-side rendering today. It's slow, breaks fairly easily, and is difficult to implement properly.

Thing is, despite what everyone might be telling you, you probably don't *need* SSR. You can get almost all the advantages of it (without the disadvantages) by using **prerendering.** Prerendering is basically firing up a headless browser, loading your app's routes, and saving the results to a static HTML file. You can then serve it with whatever static-file-serving solution you were using previously. It *just works* with HTML5 navigation and the likes. No need to change your code or add server-side rendering workarounds.

In the interest of transparency, there are some use-cases where prerendering might not be a great idea.

- **Tons of routes** - If your site has hundreds or thousands of routes, prerendering will be really slow. Sure you only have to do it once per update, but it could take ages. Most people don't end up with thousands of static routes, but just in-case...
- **Dynamic Content** - If your render routes that have content that's specific to the user viewing it or other dynamic sources, you should make sure you have placeholder components that can display until the dynamic content loads on the client-side. Otherwise it might be a tad weird.

## Available Renderers
- `prerenderer.BrowserRenderer` (builtin, default) - Opens the system default browser to render the page. Adds and removes a script from the page in the process which could potentially cause problems, though highly unlikely. Works best with Chrome and Chrome variants. This should be your first choice.		
- `prerenderer.JSDOMRenderer` (builtin) - Uses [jsdom](https://npmjs.com/package/jsdom) Extremely fast, but unreliable and cannot handle advanced usages. May not work with all front-end frameworks and apps.
- `prerenderer.ChromeRenderer` (builtin) - Uses Google Chrome in headless mode over RDP. Not blazing fast, but produces excellent results and avoids page mangling. *Requires **Chrome 59+** on macOS and Linux, and **Chrome 60+** on Windows*


### Which renderer should I use?		
**Use `BrowserRenderer` if:** You're pre-rendering maybe ten or twenty routes tops, and don't mind a bunch of tabs opening in your browser and closing again in a split second. (This can be avoided if you use Chrome with the `--headless` flag in the opn options.)		
Also, `BrowserRenderer` cannot close any opened Firefox tabs (without you first setting `dom.allow_scripts_to_close_windows` to `true` in `about:config`.) So yeah, sorry about that.		
**Use `ChromeRenderer` if:** You're prerendering up to a couple hundred pages (bye-bye RAM!), or if `BrowserRenderer`'s script injection is interfering with your app.		
**Use `JSDOMRenderer` if:** You need to prerender thousands upon thousands of pages, but quality isn't all that important, and you're willing to work around issues for more advanced cases. (Programmatic SVG support, etc.)

#### Opn configurations:

You can configure [opn](https://github.com/sindresorhus/opn) with the `opn` option to make `BrowserRenderer` less intrusive. Unfortunately, we can't do it for you because of cross-platform differences.
Here are some example setups:

**Chrome Headless Mode (Chrome 60+)**
Opens chrome in the background without creating a window and renders your pages. Similar to `ChromeRenderer`.

```javascript
new BrowserRenderer({
  opn: {
    // Mac: google-chrome, Windows: chrome, Linux: varies, probably google-chrome or google-chrome stable. chromium works too.
    app: ['google-chrome', '--headless']
  }
})
```

**Firefox Private Browsing Mode**
Opens Firefox with a separate private browsing window.

*Note: `BrowserRenderer` cannot close any opened Firefox tabs (without you first setting `dom.allow_scripts_to_close_windows` to `true` in `about:config`.)*

```javascript
new BrowserRenderer({
  opn: {
    app: ['firefox', '-private']
  }
})
```

## Caveats

- For obvious reasons, `prerenderer` only works for SPAs that route using the HTML5 history API. `index.html#/hash/route` URLs will unfortunately not work.
- Whatever client-side rendering library you're using should be able to at least replace any server-rendered content or diff with it.
  - For **Vue.js 1** use [`replace: false`](http://vuejs.org/api/#replace) on root components.
  - For **Vue.js 2**  Ensure your root component has the same id as the prerendered element it's replacing. Otherwise you'll end up with duplicated content.
